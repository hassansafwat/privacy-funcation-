# Security Functions
## Overview

This repository contains security-related Python scripts designed to enhance the protection of sensitive information and manage secure communication.

## Security Functions and Descriptions

## 1.check_show_pass

**Description:**

`check_show_pass`  is a security script that ["Two functions have been created, the first is the show_pass function to 
display the system password for employees inside the databases only, and the 
second is the check pass function to know the validity of people’s passwords, as it 
is compared with the passwords in the database.
"""].

**Usage:**

```bash
python check_show_pass [arguments].

## 2. privacy_data
**Description:**
privacy_data handles ["The provided code includes several techniques related to privacy and data protection.
 It provides a function that restricts access to data based on user roles to ensure that users only
  access data relevant to their role. The "anonymize_data" function works to anonymize user data by
  replacing specific attributes ( Such as names) with generic values (such as “anonymous”).
  The mask_ssn function also hides Social Security Numbers (SSNs) by replacing them with asterisks.
The hash_password function hashes user passwords using the SHA-256 algorithm."""].

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python privacy_data [arguments]
## 3. accountbank_management
**Description:**
accountbank_management provides [""" The code is related to managing the user account and protecting sensitive and personal information.
 The user account information is stored in a database (user_accounts) and encrypts the password using
  the SHA-256 hash function, to protect user passwords. Access to the balances is granted only by 
  authenticated persons. This protects data and accounts, in addition to not allowing unlimited
   password attempts. After a certain number of incorrect password attempts,
 the attacker is usually prevented from making further attempts."].

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python accountbank_management [arguments]

## 4. communicate_private
**Description:**

communicate_private facilitates [""" To encrypt conversations between any two parties to prevent any third party
from accessing or guessing them, and ultimately to revealing by the  the content of the message,
which may contain sensitive data that would worry people’s comfort if it were accessed,
 as it is revealed through the decryption key."].

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python communicate_private [arguments]
### 5. hash_list
**Description:**
hash_list manages ["
To hashed lists that contain dictionaries or identification numbers
The hash function was used for anonymization as hashing keys are part of anonymization operations,
 comparing data without revealing values to check if two data sets are similar without revealing the real data.
The SHA-256 algorithm was used to achieve specific privacy requirements.
"""].

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python hash_list [arguments]
